## Professionally, ##

I have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Brigham Young University.  Currently I work as a Penetration Tester at SecurityMetrics, Inc. in Orem, Utah.  And for the last decade, I worked here as a programmer (Python, PostgreSQL, Twisted, TCL, Docker, AngularJS, etc...)


## Personally, ##

I love to walk.  My ideal life includes perhaps a bike, but no car.  I enjoy hiking and biking and visiting fun people.  And cooking.  Let's not forget the food.  Also, the first ripe peach of the season is my favorite food.

Linguistics is a secret hobby of mine.  I speak Spanish, a tiny bit of French and Italian, and a bit more Shona and Ndebele.  If I could get paid to learn and speak different languages, I would sign up in a heartbeat.

I enjoy good music&mdash;playing the piano and singing.  One of my favorite feelings is the tiredness earned from working outside: digging, mowing, planting, weeding, gardening or building.

## Iffy? ##

A high school nickname.  Works well as a username, too.
