In October, I wrote, illustrated and published <a href="http://www.theproudpinkballoon.com" target="_blank">a children's book</a>.  Are you curious how much money :moneybag: such an endeavor makes?

Here's a post about the money and publishing parts of the process&mdash;things I think are interesting to read.  Maybe I'm crazy for sharing all of this information... but, like I said, I think it's interesting.

If you don't think they're interesting, you can go <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vlasic-Pickles-Kosher-Dill-Spears/dp/B000VDZ4BQ" target="_blank">buy some pickles.</a>

## Q: "How much money do you make?"

Millions.

Okay, not millions, but I'll tell you (down below).  Before releasing my book on the world, I asked <a href="http://mrjakeparker.com/" target="_blank">Jake Parker</a> why one would choose to use a publisher over self-publishing.  His answer: "So you can actually make some money."  He's right :)

## Pricing

I'm using CreateSpace and IngramSpark for the paperbacks and hardcovers respectively.  Here's the breakdown for both:

<style>
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
  min-width: 100%;
}
table td,
table th {
  border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 3px;
  text-align: center;
  vertical-align: center;
}
</style>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="100">Online orders</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Channel</th>
    <th>Sticker price</th>
    <th>Publisher's cut</th>
    <th>My cut</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Paperback sold on Amazon</td>
    <td>$8.99</td>
    <td>$7.25</td>
    <td>$1.74</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Paperback sold on CreateSpace</td>
    <td>$8.99</td>
    <td>$5.45</td>
    <td>$3.54</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hardcover</td>
    <td>$14.99</td>
    <td>$13.47</td>
    <td>$1.52</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If I wanted to make no money on paperbacks, then I could sell them for as little as $6.09.  On CreateSpace, you use this tool to adjust the price:

As the author, I can order copies directly for a wholesale amount:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="100">Author orders</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Source</th>
    <th>My price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CreateSpace</td>
    <td>$3.65 + shipping</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>IngramSpark</td>
    <td>$8.97 + shipping and fees, fees, fees</td>
  </tr>
</table>

(I wish there were no fees.  Fees make doing any kind of predictive math impossible.)  Those of you who paid $7 or $13 for your in-person-delivered books might be thinking I made a killing off of you.  Not really...

## How much I've made so far

Here's all my costs and revenue as of this writing:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Thing</th>
    <th>Income</th>
    <th>Expense</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Paint, paper, pens</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>-15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Publishing paperback</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>-14.48</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Publishing hardcover</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>-156.67</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>22 online paperbacks orders</td>
    <td>46.68</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 online hardcover orders</td>
    <td>7.60</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30 paperbacks ordered by me for in-person delivery</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>-127.50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30 hardcovers ordered by me for in-person delivery</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>-288.88</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In-person purchases</td>
    <td>374</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Total</th>
    <th>428.28</th>
    <th>-602.53</th>
    <th>= -174.25</th>
  </tr>
</table>

Since I gave a few books away as gifts, the amount of income from the in-person purchases isn't quite 30 paperbacks/30 hardcovers.


## Conclusion

So, I've made -$174.25 publishing my book :moneybag: :moneybag: :moneybag:

Would I do it again?  Absolutely.  There's definitely more expensive hobbies than book-writing.  And I had way too much fun doing it.

Would I self-publish again?  I think I'd skip the hardcover unless it was an above-average book.

Would I consider a publisher?  Yep.  It's more a question of if they'd consider me :)

Stay tuned!
