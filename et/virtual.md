Much of our modern world is virtual.  What does *virtual* mean?  I wonder if it's related to the word *virtue*.

The [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virtual&allowed_in_frame=0) says:

> late 14c., "influencing by physical virtues or capabilities, effective with respect to inherent natural qualities," from Medieval Latin virtualis, from Latin virtus "excellence, potency, efficacy," literally "manliness, manhood" (see virtue). The meaning "being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact" is from mid-15c., probably via sense of "capable of producing a certain effect" (early 15c.). Computer sense of "not physically existing but made to appear by software" is attested from 1959.

So it used to mean "manly" :)  Then it came to mean "in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact."  And now it means "not physically existing but made to appear by software."  And the word *virtue* does indeed come from [the same Latin root](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtue).  In a sense, then, does *virtual* mean that a thing has all the essential virtues of what it copies?  We'd like to think it does, most of the time.  But a picture of flowers will never compare to actual flowers.  And relationships through technology will never be as fulfilling as face-to-face ones.
