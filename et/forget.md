*Forget* is a strange-looking word.  And it's completely different-looking than it's opposite: *remember.*  Where did we get these words?  How do other languages handle these concepts?

According to the [Online Etymology Dictionary's entry](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=forget), the word *forget* is a Germanic word made of these parts:

| *for* | away, amiss, opposite |
| *get* | to grasp |

In a figurative sense, it can mean "to lose care for."  

The [entry for remember](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=remember) explains that "remember" comes from Old French *remembrer* and Latin *rememorari*:

| *re* | again |
| *memorari* | be mindful of |

"Remember" is like the word *remind*.

*Se souvenir* is how you currently say "to remember" in French (according to Google).  I wonder what made them ditch *remembrer*.  We use the word (*souvenir*) to describe the trinkets we bring back from vacation.  It kind of means "to come up from below" (*sou-* from *sub-* and *venir* = *to come*).  I like the imagery of a memory bubbling up from below&mdash;like a watery-floored museum, whose artifacts rise into view at the press of a button.

There are other English words that start with *for-* (and not *fore-*):

- *forgive*
- *forgo*

Here's "forget," "remember" and "forgive" in various languages according to Google Translate:

| English | to forget | to remember | to forgive |
| Spanish | *olvidar* | *recordar* | *perdonar* |
| French | *oublier* | *se souvenir* | *pardonner* |
| Italian | *dimenticare* | *ricordare* | *perdonare* |
| German | ***ver**gessen* | *erinnern* | ***ver**zeihen* |
| Dutch | ***ver**geten* | *onthouden* | *te **ver**geven* |
| Latin | *ut obliviscatur* | *et recordabor* | *dimitte* |
| Hebrew | *לשכוח* | *לזכור* | *לסלוח* |
| Japanese | *忘れる* | *覚えておくべき* | *許す* |
| Shona | *kukanganwa* | *nekurangarira* | *kukanganwira* |
| Zulu | *ukuba akhohlwe* | *ukukhumbula* | *ukuthethelela* |

You can see that both German and Dutch have the *for-* equivalent (*ver-*) in both "forget" and "forgive."


I think the similarity between Shona's *forget* and *forgive* is interesting, but I don't know enough Shona to know if the similarity is meaningful or not (hyphens added for emphasis):

<pre>
 forget:  ku - ka - nga - nwa
forgive:  ku - ka - nga - nwi - ra
</pre>

And then... now, why am I writing this again?
