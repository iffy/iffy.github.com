I like to draw and paint sometimes.  Here are two semi-recent watercolor paintings.  This first was an attempt to copy <a href="http://www.toca-ch.com/collection/elephant-backgrounds/#photo_5" target="_blank">this photo</a>.

My daughter lost the ladybug she was carrying on our way home from church.  She was sad, so I suggested we make and hang up *Missing* signs.
