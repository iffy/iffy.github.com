There are two kinds of people in this world: sources and sinks.  Those who give and those who take.  You know that guy who always makes you feel optimistic and hopeful? He's a source.  As Oscar Wilde put it:

> Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.  

Some live as a life-giving spring: feeding and inspiring nearby folks as they wend their way across the land.

Anyway...

as I work on various projects, I've noticed that one thing motivates me almost more than anything else&mdash;gratitude.  Yes, yes, when we got our first sale I did a little dance.  That was exciting and motivating.  But when people stop to say thank you, in an email, post or chat, it motivates me all the more.  A little thanks can make a lonely, discouraging day much brighter.  Because truthfully, we all waffle between being sources and sinks at times.

Consider who you could thank today.  A spouse, child, co-worker, cashier, open source maintainer, stranger or friend.

Be a source.
