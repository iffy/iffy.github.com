*Discrimination* typically has a bad connotation.  But it means a good thing (or sophisticated at least) when you talk about someone having a "discriminating eye for art" or ["discriminating palate"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate).  Without doing any research, I feel like I can see two meaningful parts in the word:

- *dis-* probably means not or *un-* or some other kind of negative.
- *crimin-* looks criminal or suspect :)

Does it mean to make something uncriminal?  That doesn't jive with how people use it.

From the [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=discriminate&allowed_in_frame=0):

> 1620s, from Latin *discriminatus*, past participle of *discriminare* "to divide, separate," from *discrimen* (genitive *discriminis*) "interval, distinction, difference," derived noun from *discernere* (see [*discern*](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=discern&allowed_in_frame=0)). The adverse (usually racial) sense is first recorded 1866, American English. Positive sense remains in [*discriminating*](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=discriminating&allowed_in_frame=0). ... Also used 17c. and after as an adjective meaning "distinct."
