I made a [tool to easily get video of a specific General Conference quote](http://www.iffycan.com/generalconference/tools/quotes.html).

In the [LDS Church](https://www.lds.org), twice a year we have [General Conference](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/)&mdash;a weekend of listening to talks given by our leaders, the Apostles and Prophet.  In all, the conference is about 12 hours long.  Here's a sample (or you can read it [here](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/it-works-wonderfully?lang=eng)):

Sometimes, when I'm asked to teach a class at church, I like to read quotes from General Conference to illustrate or emphasize a point.  Occasionally, I instead like to play a clip of the original video or audio.

So I made [this](http://www.iffycan.com/generalconference/tools/quotes.html).  You choose a talk, click on the words you want, and it generates a link to the YouTube video for that snippet.  I have plans for other improvements and welcome any feedback you have.

Also, if you'd like to help out tagging the talks so that they work in the tool, you can [here](http://www.iffycan.com/generalconference/).
