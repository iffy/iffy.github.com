Words are powerful&mdash;spoken or written.  Words can both incite and calm.  They make you laugh and cry.  Words change your behavior.  Through words, you learn about the world.

And nowadays we have Emoji, too! :tada:

In my freshman English class, we studied the concepts of ethos, pathos and logos as mechanisms for persuasion.  Quick (imperfect) review:

- ethos = your (perceived) credentials :squirrel:
- pathos = emotional :heart_eyes:
- logos = logic :bulb:

For one assignment, we had to identify how a persuasive speaker/writer used ethos/pathos/logos to persuade people.  I chose to study Hitler.  Yes, Adolf.  He definitely qualifies as persuasive.

In studying a few of his speeches, I noticed a fourth method of persuasion: lying.  Hitler told bold-faced, blatant lies and gave false promises.  Technically, lying is not a persuasive technique (and my teacher pointed that out and had me elide those parts)&mdash;rather, you use pathos/ethos/logos to peddle your lies persuasively.

I've never forgotten that.  Hitler convinced otherwise normal people to do horrendous things, and he relied heavily on persuasive deception to do it.

Words.

We are surrounded by words.  And I want to point out that **some of the words we swim in are not genuine.**  Some deceive intentionally and others innocently.

Now picture this situation:

A few thousand years ago, an angry man wanted to make himself king.  After failing, he was chased from his land into the country of his enemies.  This man's people and their enemies had been at war for some time&mdash;and they were fatigued from all the fighting.  They didn't want to be involved in any more wars.  Sound like any countries you know?

Eventually, by backhanded means including multiple murders, this man achieved influence in the government of his enemies.  And he decided to use that influence to make his once-enemies go to war against his own people.  The war-weary populace had vowed not to fight anymore.  And so, this evil man did this:

> ...he began to inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, **he did appoint men to speak** unto the Lamanites **from their towers,** against the Nephites.  ([Alma 48:1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/48.1))

Over the course of a year this man persuaded the war-weary people, who had vowed not to fight, to go to war against XXX
